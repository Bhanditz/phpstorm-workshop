TODO: Set up for Docker
1. Using Search Everywhere, find the Remote Host tool window.
2. Copy existing vm server and specify "Root path" to be "/home/vagrant" or click "Autodetect"
3. Browse the remote host and copy some files from the current project to the remote server.
   This can be done using drag and drop, or using the context menu.
